## Hi Everypony
I go by Kawasaki (or Saki for short)
I use GitHub to post and organize my own little projects.

My main focus is on learning Java through making simulation software, small games, and simple tools. <br>
This isn't really a professional profile for anything, I just like having fun. <br>
However, this could become a professional profile, but it will still remain fun because what's the point of it not. <br>

xoxo
