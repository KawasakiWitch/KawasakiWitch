## Hi Everypony
I go by Kawasaki (or Saki for short)
I use GitHub to post and organize my own little projects.

My main focus is on learning Java through making tools that I find useful in everyday life. <br>
I just like having fun with coding. <br>
<br>
📝If I'm not coding I'm probably writing <br>
⛩️I speak Japanese. Sometimes my comments are in Japanese <br>
🩷Usually listening to music when I code <br>
##
xoxo
